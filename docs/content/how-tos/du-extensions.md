The input file in this example `Library.fs` looks like this:

```fsharp
namespace Example
open Myriad.Plugins

[<Generator.DuCases>]
type Currency =
| CAD
| PLN
| EUR
| USD
| Custom of string

```

An attribute is used by the plugin so that the code generator plugin knows which parts of the input AST are to be used by the plugin.  If you had several records and you only want the fields plugin to operate on `Currency` then the attribute would be used like in the example about to only apply `Generator.DuCases` to `Currency`.  Note, if you wanted a plugin that just needs the whole input AST then there is no need to provide an input.  Myriad aims to be a library rather than a full framework that ties you to the mechanism used to input and generate code.

The fields plugin in this example will generate the following code at prebuild time and compile the code into your assembly:
```fsharp
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//        This code was generated by myriad.
//        Changes to this file will be lost when the code is regenerated.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace rec Test

module Currency =
    open Input

    let toString (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | CAD -> "CAD"
        | PLN -> "PLN"
        | EUR -> "EUR"
        | USD -> "USD"
        | Custom _ -> "Custom"

    let fromString (x: string) =
        match x with
        | "CAD" -> Some CAD
        | "PLN" -> Some PLN
        | "EUR" -> Some EUR
        | "USD" -> Some USD
        | _ -> None

    let toTag (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | CAD -> 0
        | PLN -> 1
        | EUR -> 2
        | USD -> 3
        | Custom _ -> 4

    let isCAD (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | CAD -> true
        | _ -> false

    let isPLN (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | PLN -> true
        | _ -> false

    let isEUR (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | EUR -> true
        | _ -> false

    let isUSD (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | USD -> true
        | _ -> false

    let isCustom (x: Currency) =
        match x with
        | Custom _ -> true
        | _ -> false
