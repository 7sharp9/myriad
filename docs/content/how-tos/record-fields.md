The input file in this example `Library.fs` looks like this:

```fsharp
namespace Example
open Myriad.Plugins

[<Generator.Fields>]
type Test1 = { one: int; two: string; three: float; four: float32 }
type Test2 = { one: Test1; two: string }
```

An attribute is used by the plugin so that the code generator plugin knows which parts of the input AST are to be used by the plugin.  If you had several records and you only want the fields plugin to operate on `Test1` then the attribute would be used like in the example about to only apply `Generator.Fields` to `Test1`.  Note, if you wanted a plugin that just needs the whole input AST then there is no need to provide an input.  Myriad aims to be a library rather than a full framework that ties you to the mechanism used to input and generate code.

The fields plugin in this example will generate the following code at prebuild time and compile the code into your assembly:
```fsharp
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//        This code was generated by myriad.
//        Changes to this file will be lost when the code is regenerated.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace rec Test

module Test1 =
    open Example

    let one (x : Test1) = x.one
    let two (x : Test1) = x.two
    let three (x : Test1) = x.three
    let four (x : Test1) = x.four

    let create (one : Test1) (two : string) (three : float) (four : float32) : Test1 =
        { one = one
          two = two
          three = three
          four = four }

    let map (mapone : int -> int) (maptwo : string -> string) (mapthree : float -> float) (mapfour : float32 -> float32) (record': Test1) =
      { record' with
          one = mapone record'.one
          two = maptwo record'.two
          three = mapthree record'.three
          four = mapfour record'.four }
```

The fields plugin generates a `map` for each field in the input record, a `create` function taking each field, and a `map` function that takes one function per field in the input record.

The map functions for each field are useful in situations where you just want to use a single field from a record in a lambda like a list of records:
```fsharp
let records = [{one = "a"; two = "aa"; three = 42.0; four = 172.0f}
               {one = "b"; two = "bb"; three = 42.0; four = 172.0f}]
 records |> List.sortBy Test1.one
```
